// iterPos describes the state of the internal iterator, in terms of whether it
// is at the position returned to the user (cur), one ahead of the position
// returned (next for forward iteration and prev for reverse iteration). The cur
// position is split into two states, for forward and reverse iteration, since
// we need to differentiate for switching directions.
//
// There is subtlety in what is considered the current position of the Iterator.
// The internal iterator exposes a sequence of internal keys. There is not
// always a single internalIterator position corresponding to the position
// returned to the user. Consider the example:
//
//	a.MERGE.9 a.MERGE.8 a.MERGE.7 a.SET.6 b.DELETE.9 b.DELETE.5 b.SET.4
//	\                                   /
//	  \       Iterator.Key() = 'a'    /
//
// The Iterator exposes one valid position at user key 'a' and the two exhausted
// positions at the beginning and end of iteration. The underlying
// internalIterator contains 7 valid positions and 2 exhausted positions.
//
// Iterator positioning methods must set iterPos to iterPosCur{Foward,Backward}
// iff the user key at the current internalIterator position equals the
// Iterator.Key returned to the user. This guarantees that a call to nextUserKey
// or prevUserKey will advance to the next or previous iterator position.
// iterPosCur{Forward,Backward} does not make any guarantee about the internal
// iterator position among internal keys with matching user keys, and it will
// vary subtly depending on the particular key kinds encountered. In the above
// example, the iterator returning 'a' may set iterPosCurForward if the internal
// iterator is positioned at any of a.MERGE.9, a.MERGE.8, a.MERGE.7 or a.SET.6.
//
// When setting iterPos to iterPosNext or iterPosPrev, the internal iterator
// must be advanced to the first internalIterator position at a user key greater
// (iterPosNext) or less (iterPosPrev) than the key returned to the user. An
// internalIterator position that's !Valid() must also be considered greater or
// less—depending on the direction of iteration—than the last valid Iterator
// position.

// SeekPrefixGE moves the iterator to the first key/value pair whose key is
// greater than or equal to the given key and which has the same "prefix" as
// the given key. The prefix for a key is determined by the user-defined
// Comparer.Split function. The iterator will not observe keys not matching the
// "prefix" of the search key. Calling SeekPrefixGE puts the iterator in prefix
// iteration mode. The iterator remains in prefix iteration until a subsequent
// call to another absolute positioning method (SeekGE, SeekLT, First,
// Last). Reverse iteration (Prev) is not supported when an iterator is in
// prefix iteration mode. Returns true if the iterator is pointing at a valid
// entry and false otherwise.
//
// The semantics of SeekPrefixGE are slightly unusual and designed for
// iteration to be able to take advantage of bloom filters that have been
// created on the "prefix". If you're not using bloom filters, there is no
// reason to use SeekPrefixGE.
//
// An example Split function may separate a timestamp suffix from the prefix of
// the key.
//
//	Split(<key>@<timestamp>) -> <key>
//
// Consider the keys "a@1", "a@2", "aa@3", "aa@4". The prefixes for these keys
// are "a", and "aa". Note that despite "a" and "aa" sharing a prefix by the
// usual definition, those prefixes differ by the definition of the Split
// function. To see how this works, consider the following set of calls on this
// data set:
//
//	SeekPrefixGE("a@0") -> "a@1"
//	Next()              -> "a@2"
//	Next()              -> EOF
//
// If you're just looking to iterate over keys with a shared prefix, as
// defined by the configured comparer, set iterator bounds instead:
//
//	iter := db.NewIter(&pebble.IterOptions{
//	  LowerBound: []byte("prefix"),
//	  UpperBound: []byte("prefiy"),
//	})
//	for iter.First(); iter.Valid(); iter.Next() {
//	  // Only keys beginning with "prefix" will be visited.
//	}
//
// See ExampleIterator_SeekPrefixGE for a working example.
//
// When iterating with range keys enabled, all range keys encountered are
// truncated to the seek key's prefix's bounds. The truncation of the upper
// bound requires that the database's Comparer is configured with a
// ImmediateSuccessor method. For example, a SeekPrefixGE("a@9") call with the
// prefix "a" will truncate range key bounds to [a,ImmediateSuccessor(a)].
